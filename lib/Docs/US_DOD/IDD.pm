=head1 DATA ITEM DESCRIPTION

The following establishes the data general and content
requirements for the identified data item. 

=head1 1. TITLE

Interface Design Document (IDD)

=head1 2. IDENTIFICATION NUMBER

DI-IPSC-81436

=head1 3. DESCRIPTION/PURPOSE

=head2 3.1

The Interface Design Description (IDD) describes the interface
characteristics of one or more systems, subsystems, Hardware Configuration
Items (HWCIs), Computer Software Configuration Items (CSCIs),
manual operations, or other system components. An IDD may describe
any number of interfaces.

=head2 3.2

The IDD can be used to supplement the System/Subsystem Design
Description (SSDD) (DIIPSC-81432), Software Design Description
(SDD) (DI-IPSC-81435), and Database Design Description (DBDD)
(DI-IPSC-81437). The IDD and its companion Interface Requirements
Specification (IRS) (DI-IPSC-81434) serve to communicate and control
interface design decisions.

6a. DTIC APPLICABLE

6b. GIDEP APPLICABLE

=head1 7. APPLICATION/INTERRELATIONSHIP

=head2 7.1 

This Data Item Description (DID) contains the format and content
preparation instructions for the data product generated by specific
and discrete task requirements as delineated in the contract.

=head2 7.2 

This DID is used when the developer is tasked to define and
record the interface design of one or more systems, subsystems,
HWCIs, CSCIs, manual operations, or other system components.

=head2 7.3

The IRS specifies interface requirements; the IDD describes
interface characteristics selected to meet those requirements.
The IDD may reference the IRS to avoid repeating information.
The IDD can be used to supplement the SSDD, SDD, or DBDD.

=head2 7.4 

The Contract Data Requirements List (CDRL) (DD 1423) should
specify whether deliverable data are to be delivered on paper
or electronic media; are to be in a given electronic form (such
as ASCII, CALS, or compatible with a specified word processor
or other support software); may be delivered in developer format
rather than in the format specified herein; and may reside in
a computer-aided software engineering (CASE) or other automated
tool rather than in the form of a traditional document.

=head2 7.5 

This DID supersedes DI-MCCR-80027A.

alternative form, this information shall be included on external
and internal labels or by equivalent identification methods.

=item d. Table of contents. 

The document shall contain a table
of contents providing the number, title, and page number of each
titled paragraph, figure, table, and appendix. For data in a database
or other alternative form, this information shall consist of an
internal or external table of contents containing pointers to,
or instructions for accessing, each paragraph, figure, table,
and appendix or their equivalents.

=item  e. Page numbering/labeling. 

Each page shall contain a unique
page number and display the document number, including version,
volume, and date, as applicable. For data in a database or other
alternative form, files, screens, or other entities shall be assigned
names or numbers in such a way that desired data can be indexed
and accessed.

=item f. Response to tailoring instructions.

If a paragraph is
tailored out of this DID, the resulting document shall contain
the corresponding paragraph number and title, followed by &quot;This
paragraph has been tailored out.&quot; For data in a database
or other alternative form, this representation need occur only
in the table of contents or equivalent.

=item g. Multiple paragraphs and subparagraphs.

Any section,
paragraph, or subparagraph in this DID may be written as multiple
paragraphs or subparagraphs to enhance readability.

=item h. Standard data descriptions.

If a data description required
by this DID has been published in a standard data element dictionary
specified in the contract, reference to an entry in that dictionary
is preferred over including the description itself.

=item i. Substitution of existing documents.

Commercial or other existing documents may be substituted for all or part of the document
if they contain the required data.

=back

=head2 10.2 Content requirements.

Content requirements begin on the following page. The numbers
shown designate the paragraph numbers to be used in the document.
Each such number is understood to have the prefix '10.2'
within this DID. For example, the paragraph numbered 1.1 is understood
to be paragraph 10.2.1.1 within this DID.

=head2 1. Scope<

This section shall be divided into the following paragraphs.

=head2 1.1 Identification.

This section shall list the number, title, revision, and date
of all documents referenced in this document. This section shall
also identify the source for all documents not available through
normal Government stocking activities.

=head2 3. Interface design.

This section shall be divided into the following paragraphs to
describe the interface characteristics of one or more systems,
subsystems, configuration items, manual operations, or other system
components. If part or all of the design depends upon system states
or modes, this dependency shall be indicated. If design information
falls into more than one paragraph, it may be presented once and
referenced from the other paragraphs. If part or all of this information
is documented elsewhere, it may be referenced. Design conventions
needed to understand the design shall be presented or referenced.

=head2 3.1 Interface identification and diagrams.

For each interface identified in 1.1, this paragraph shall state
the project-unique identifier assigned to the interface and shall
identify the interfacing entities (systems, configuration items,
users, etc.) by name, number, version, and documentation references,
as applicable. The identification shall state which entities have
fixed interface characteristics (and therefore impose interface
requirements on interfacing entities) and which are being developed
or modified (thus having interface requirements imposed on them).
One or more interface diagrams shall be provided, as appropriate,
to depict the interfaces.

=head2 3.x (Project-unique identifier of interface).

This paragraph (beginning with 3.2) shall identify an interface
by project-unique identifier, shall briefly identify the interfacing
entities, and shall be divided into subparagraphs as needed to
describe the interface characteristics of one or both of the interfacing
entities. If a given interfacing entity is not covered by this
IDD (for example, an external system) but its interface characteristics
need to be mentioned to describe interfacing entities that are,
these characteristics shall be stated as assumptions or as &quot;When
[the entity not covered] does this, [the entity that is covered]
will ....&quot; This paragraph may reference other documents (such
as data dictionaries, standards for protocols, and standards for
user interfaces) in place of stating the information here. The
design description shall include the following, as applicable,
presented in any order suited to the information to be provided,
