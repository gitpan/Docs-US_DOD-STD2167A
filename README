  3.3 Changes

    Changes are as follows:

    *   Clean-up the modules without content.

    *   Combined the svd file database and the SVD program module into this
        SVD program module.

    *   Move this SVD program module from SVD:: to Docs::Site_SVD::

    *   Added a test for the SVD.

    *   Moved from US_DOD to Docs::US_DOD per discussion on CPAN.

  3.4 Adaptation data.

    This installation requires that the installation site has the Perl
    programming language installed. Installation sites running Microsoft
    Operating systems require the installation of Unix utilities. An
    excellent, highly recommended Unix utilities for Microsoft operating
    systems is unxutils by Karl M. Syring. A copy is available at the
    following web sites:

     http://unxutils.sourceforge.net
     http://packages.SoftwareDiamnds.com

    There are no other additional requirements or tailoring needed of
    configurations files, adaptation data or other software needed for this
    installation particular to any installation site.

  3.5 Related documents.

    There are no related documents needed for the installation and test of
    this release.

  3.6 Installation instructions.

    To installed the release file, use the CPAN module in the Perl release
    or the INSTALL.PL script at the following web site:

     http://packages.SoftwareDiamonds.com

    Follow the instructions for the the chosen installation software.

    The distribution file is at the following respositories:

       http://www.softwarediamonds/packages/Docs-US_DOD-STD2167A-0.01
       http://www.perl.com/CPAN-local/authors/id/S/SO/SOFTDIA/Docs-US_DOD-STD2167A-0.01

  3.6.1 Installation support.

    If there are installation problems or questions with the installation
    contact

     03 882-0846 E<lt>support@SoftwareDiamonds.comE<gt>

  3.6.2 Installation Tests.

    Most Perl installation software will run the following test script(s) as
    part of the installation:

     t/docs/US_DOD/STD2167A.t

  3.7 Possible problems and known errors

    None of the PODs contain any of the figures from the hard-copy versions.
    The following PODs do not contain any documents and an empty POD is
    included only to resolve links when the converted documents converted to
    PODs cites documents not converted to PODs:

     CDRL.pod
     CRISD.pod
     CSCI.pod
     CSOM.pod
     ECP.pod
     HWCI.pod
     IDD.pod
     SCN.pod
     SDR.pod
     SPM.pod
     SRR.pod
     SSD.pod
     VDD.pod

    For Perl module releases, these documents may not be applicable. Many of
    them apply for establishing large software applications and complex
    systems involving both hardware and software while others establish
    format, legally binding, contractual requirements between the supplier
    and consumer of the data. Neither of these apply for this document.

4.0 NOTES
    The following are useful acronyms:

    .t  extension for a Perl test script file

    DID Data Item Description
